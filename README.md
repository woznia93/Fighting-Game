# Snake Game in C++

## Description
This project is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using C++. The game is played in the console and involves controlling a snake to eat food, which makes the snake grow longer. The game ends if the snake runs into itself or the walls.

## Features
- Console-based gameplay
- Snake grows longer as it eats food
- Game over when the snake collides with itself or the walls
- Simple controls using arrow keys

## Requirements
- C++ compiler (e.g., g++)
- Make (optional, for using the provided Makefile)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/snake-game-cpp.git
    cd snake-game-cpp
    ```

2. Compile the game:
    ```sh
    g++ -o snake main.cpp
    ```

    Alternatively, if you have `make` installed, you can use the provided Makefile:
    ```sh
    make
    ```

## Usage
Run the compiled executable to start the game:
```sh
./snake

Use the arrow keys to control the snake:

Up Arrow: Move up
Down Arrow: Move down
Left Arrow: Move left
Right Arrow: Move right
Code Structure
